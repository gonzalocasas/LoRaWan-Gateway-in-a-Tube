# LoRaWan-Gateway-in-a-Tube
This short "tutorial" visualize the housing of an IMST iC880A - LoRaWAN Concentrator 868MHz together with a RaspberyPi
The power is delivered by PoE and a step-down booster (12V -> 5V)

many thanks to Hanspeter for his support during design and laser cutting of the carrier board (funlab.ch)
